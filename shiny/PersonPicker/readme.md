# Introduction

This folder contains a modification of the code chunk in [section 16.3.2](https://mastering-shiny.org/reactivity-components.html#accumulating-inputs) of Wickham's [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html), also available as a physical book [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Shiny-Interactive-Reports-Dashboards/dp/1492047384). (Other booksellers are available.)

# Modification

The original code allowed the user to enter a series of names, then display them. 
The modification of the code allows one of the names to be selected at random. 

# Aims

## Facilitating meetings 

The aim of this is to support more equitable participation in meetings and workshops, by allowing attendees to be selected at random, rather than on the basis of personal preference. 
Often, within meetings, the same two or three people may keep volunteering, meaning the contents of such meetings may be dominated by these few individuals, whereas the more quiet attendees, who can potentially gain more from speaking and leading part of a meeting, stay quiet, meaning over time initial differentials in both preference for and skill in 'public' speaking compound over time. 

## Technical

The app is intended both to show how reactive values can be used in practice, and how existing example code can be adapted to other purposes.
